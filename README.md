## Official Glitzzes

### The LTI Gltizzes (WIP, more to come...)

- **[Do you know your L, T and I](/lti/whatislti.md)** see if you know what LTI is and what are its use cases.

### Debug Quiz

- **[There is no Glitch!](/test/testquiz.md)** glitzes or glitches? Let's test with a simple Glitz (used to debug this app!)
